  abstract = "We have combined standard micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion
              of nuclei with a modified protocol for constructing paired-end
              DNA sequencing libraries to map both nucleosomes and
              subnucleosome-sized particles at single base-pair resolution
              throughout the budding yeast genome. We found that partially
              unwrapped nucleosomes and subnucleosome-sized particles can
              occupy the same position within a cell population, suggesting
              dynamic behavior. By varying the time of MNase digestion, we have
              been able to observe changes that reflect differential
              sensitivity of particles, including the eviction of nucleosomes.
              To characterize DNA-binding features of transcription factors, we
              plotted the length of each fragment versus its position in the
              genome, which defined the minimal protected region of each
              factor. This process led to the precise mapping of protected and
              exposed regions at and around binding sites, and also
              determination of the degree to which they are flanked by phased
              nucleosomes and subnucleosome-sized particles. Our protocol and
              mapping method provide a general strategy for epigenome
              characterization, including nucleosome phasing and dynamics,
              ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelers, and transcription factors,
              from a single-sequenced sample.",

              making the positioning of nucleosomes within regulatory regions
              crucial to the regulation of gene expression. Using the assay of
              transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq), we observe a highly
              structured pattern of DNA fragment lengths and positions around
              nucleosomes in S. cerevisiae, and use this distinctive
              two-dimensional nucleosomal ``fingerprint'' as the basis for a
              new nucleosome-positioning algorithm called NucleoATAC. We show
              that NucleoATAC can identify the rotational and translational
              positions of nucleosomes with up to base pair resolution and
              provide quantitative measures of nucleosome occupancy in S.

              application of NucleoATAC to a number of outstanding problems in

              underlying nucleosome positioning, promoter chromatin
